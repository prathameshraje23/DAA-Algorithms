//Implement Kruskalâ€™s algorithm & Prim's algorithm to find Minimum
//Spanning Tree (MST) of the given an undirected, connected and
//weighted graph.

//1) How many edges does a minimum spanning tree for above example?
//Ans. Every spanning tree of graph G(V,E) must contain V-1 edges where V is
//the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph. In
//above graph total 10 vertices are present so minimum spanning tree of above
//graph will contain 10-1 that is 9 edges.

//2) In a graph G. let the edge u v have the least weight. is it true that u v is
//always part of any minimum spanning tree of G?.Justify your answers.
//Ans. Let a graph be G, and let it have V vertices and E edges.

//1. Now suppose you are able to manage a Minimum Spanning Tree T, such
//that the edge(u,v) is not included in T. (edge(u,v) is the least weighted edge).

//2. Now, the MST has V-1 edges and has no cycles. Now add the edge (u,v)
//to your MST.

//3. Now you will notice that one cycle forms in T due to the addition of
//edge(u,v). The cycle includes edge(u,v) and other edges which are part of T.

//4. In this cycle, select an edge whose weight is highest, it certainly will not
//be edge(u,v) because edge(u,v) has least weight. Hence you will select an edge
//from your earlier Minimum Spanning Tree T. Let this edge be E1.

//5. Now, remove E1 from T and add edge(u,v). Let this tree be called T_min.

//6. When we removed one edge from the cycle, connectivity of the new tree
//is still maintained.

//7. Also, as there are still V-1 edges so, there are no cycles in T_min. Hence
//T_min is a spanning tree. We still need to prove T_min as minimum spanning
//tree in order to prove.

//8. Weight ( T_min ) = Weight( T ) - (E1 - edge(u,v)).

//9. (E1 - edge(u,v)) is a positive entity as the question has already specified
//edge(u,v) to be minimum.

//10. Thus Weight (T_min) < Weight (T) , hence T can not be a minimum
//spanning tree. T_min is the minimum spanning tree which has edge(u,v).

//11. Thus, it is true that u v is always part of any minimum spanning tree of G.


//3) Let G be a graph and T be a minimum spanning tree of G. Suppose that
//the weight of an edge e is decreased. How can you find the minimum spanning
//tree of the modified graph? What is the runtime of your solution?
//Ans. This should be done in O(n) time. Given G be graph with n vertices and T
//be an minimum cost spanning tree and e be an edge not in T whose weight is
//decreased. We don't need to create MST again.

//1. Using DFS find the simple path for edge e in T. Cycle is guaranteed
//because MST has n-1 edges and an extra edge will obviously form a cycle.

//2. Find an edge weight w on that unique path which is maximum among all
//edge weight.

//3. Now check if weight of w is greater than that of e, then replace w in T
//with edge e.

//4. It'll take O(No. of Vertices) time because in worst case all vertices could
//be present in cycle and here n represents total vertices O(n).
//This can be done in linear time.

//4) Find order of edges for Kruskal's and Prim's?
